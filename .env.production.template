# Notes for Railway Deployment:
# 1. Railway automatically sets REDIS_URL when Redis service is added
# 2. PORT is automatically set by Railway
# 3. All other variables should be set in Railway's environment settings
# 4. MLflow data will be stored in the container filesystem (ephemeral)
# 5. For persistent MLflow storage, configure external MLflow server
