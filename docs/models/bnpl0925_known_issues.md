## Detailed Issue Descriptions

### 1. Feature Importance Anomaly

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Non-blocking, investigate next sprint
**Discovered:** Feature importance analysis in `research/notebooks/03_model_development.ipynb`

**Problem:** Ridge model coefficients uniformly distributed around ~0.0009 across all 36 features, suggesting over-regularization or scaling issues.

**Evidence:**
- All coefficients â‰ˆ 0.0009 (unnaturally uniform)
- Key risk indicators not in top features
- Model performance adequate (0.616 AUC) but potentially suboptimal

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- StandardScaler over-suppressing high-signal features
- Critical features accidentally removed during pipeline
- Ridge alpha=10.0 too aggressive for feature set

**Next Steps:**
```python
# Investigation code for next sprint
critical_features = ['risk_score', 'risk_level_encoded', 'customer_credit_score_range_encoded']
# Check presence and coefficients of critical features
```

### 2. Business Performance Gap

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Monitor post-deployment
**Context:** Connected to Issue #1

**Problem:** Ridge discrimination ratio (0.9x) underperforms rule-based baseline (2.8x).

**Analysis:**
- Technical metrics sound (0.616 AUC, stable)
- Business impact suboptimal
- Likely resolves with Issue #1 fix

**Acceptance:** Research phase considers this deployable because:
- Solid technical foundation
- Production SLAs met (<1ms latency)
- Real performance measurable via A/B testing

### 3. Feature Engineering Optimization

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Future enhancement
**Priority:** Low

**Opportunities:**
- Interaction features (`risk_score * amount`)
- Polynomial features for non-linear relationships
- Advanced temporal patterns
- Target encoding for categorical features

**Current State:** 36 features, production-ready pipeline, 4.9% default rate

## Research Phase Status

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE
**Production Deployment:** ðŸš€ APPROVED
**Handoff:** Ready for engineering implementation

### 4. Ensemble Probability Calibration

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Production workaround implemented
**Discovered:** Production inference pipeline development
**Impact:** Ensemble predictions exclude RidgeClassifier due to uncalibrated probabilities

**Problem:** VotingClassifier ensemble contains mixed estimator types:
- **LogisticRegression** (L1 & ElasticNet): Has `predict_proba()` with calibrated probabilities
- **RidgeClassifier**: Only has `decision_function()` with uncalibrated scores

**Current Workaround:**
```python
# Only average models with calibrated probability outputs
# RidgeClassifier excluded from ensemble probability calculation
ensemble_prediction = np.mean([logistic_prob, elastic_prob])  # Excludes ridge
```

**Root Cause:** RidgeClassifier decision function outputs are not calibrated probabilities. Converting with sigmoid (`1/(1+exp(-score))`) produces arbitrary probability-like values without proper calibration.

**Proper Solution for Next Training Cycle:**
```python
from sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV

# Wrap RidgeClassifier with calibration during training
ridge_calibrated = CalibratedClassifierCV(RidgeClassifier(alpha=1000.0), cv=3)
ridge_calibrated.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Now ensemble can use all models with proper probabilities
ensemble = VotingClassifier([
    ('ridge', ridge_calibrated),    # Now has predict_proba()
    ('logistic', logistic_model),
    ('elastic', elastic_model)
])
```

**Current Impact:**
- Ensemble predictions functional but only use 2/3 models
- Ridge's contribution limited to individual model predictions
- Acceptable for v0.1.0 deployment, should fix in v0.2.0

**Next Actions:**
1. Model serialization and deployment (separate PR)
2. Post-deployment monitoring setup
3. Issue #1/#2 investigation in optimization sprint
4. Issue #4 calibration fix in next training cycle
