# Known Issues - BNPL ML Model

## Overview

The BNPL ML model research phase is **COMPLETE** with known issues documented below. These issues do not block production deployment but should be addressed in future optimization sprints.

## Issue Summary

1. [Feature Importance Anomaly](#1-feature-importance-anomaly) - ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority
2. [Business Performance Gap](#2-business-performance-gap) - ðŸŸ¡ High Priority
3. [Feature Engineering Optimization](#3-feature-engineering-optimization) - ðŸŸ¢ Future Enhancement

## Detailed Issue Descriptions

### 1. Feature Importance Anomaly

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Non-blocking, investigate next sprint
**Discovered:** Feature importance analysis in `research/notebooks/03_model_development.ipynb`

**Problem:** Ridge model coefficients uniformly distributed around ~0.0009 across all 36 features, suggesting over-regularization or scaling issues.

**Evidence:**
- All coefficients â‰ˆ 0.0009 (unnaturally uniform)
- Key risk indicators not in top features
- Model performance adequate (0.616 AUC) but potentially suboptimal

**Root Cause Hypothesis:**
- StandardScaler over-suppressing high-signal features
- Critical features accidentally removed during pipeline
- Ridge alpha=10.0 too aggressive for feature set

**Next Steps:**
```python
# Investigation code for next sprint
critical_features = ['risk_score', 'risk_level_encoded', 'customer_credit_score_range_encoded']
# Check presence and coefficients of critical features
```

### 2. Business Performance Gap

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Monitor post-deployment
**Context:** Connected to Issue #1

**Problem:** Ridge discrimination ratio (0.9x) underperforms rule-based baseline (2.8x).

**Analysis:**
- Technical metrics sound (0.616 AUC, stable)
- Business impact suboptimal
- Likely resolves with Issue #1 fix

**Acceptance:** Research phase considers this deployable because:
- Solid technical foundation
- Production SLAs met (<1ms latency)
- Real performance measurable via A/B testing

### 3. Feature Engineering Optimization

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Future enhancement
**Priority:** Low

**Opportunities:**
- Interaction features (`risk_score * amount`)
- Polynomial features for non-linear relationships
- Advanced temporal patterns
- Target encoding for categorical features

**Current State:** 36 features, production-ready pipeline, 4.9% default rate
