# BNPL Production Deployment v0.1.0

## Phase 2: Core Pipeline Development

Production deployment of BNPL ML models with shadow mode capabilities.

### Current Implementation Status

- [x] Production branch setup
- [x] Artifact validation (6/6 models ready)
- [ ] Single-transaction feature engineering
- [ ] Multi-model predictor
- [ ] API endpoints
- [ ] Shadow mode controller
- [ ] Docker + Railway deployment

### Target Architecture

```
API Request → Feature Engineering → Multi-Model Prediction → Shadow Logging → Business Decision
```

### Performance Goals

- <100ms transaction processing (from 2ms research baseline)
- 36 features exactly matching training pipeline
- Support for 4 model deployment modes

## Next Steps

1. Implement `engineer_single_transaction()` method
2. Create flexible `BNPLPredictor` class
3. Build REST API endpoints
4. Add MLflow integration
5. Docker containerization for Railway
